### Practice 8: Count Occurrences in an Array
## Instruction:
Write a function called countOccurrences that takes an array of strings as a parameter. The function should return an object where the keys are the strings from the array, and the values are the number of times each string appeared.

## Example Input:

``` JS
const words = ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'apple'];
countOccurrences(words);
```

## Expected Output:
``` JS 
{ apple: 3, banana: 2, orange: 1 }
```
